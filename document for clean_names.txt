This is to document about my code clean_names.py

I made this code by doing in a form of function as it can be used whenever needed.

Objective:
• Remove extra spaces
• Convert everything to lowercase
• Capitalize the first letter
• Print the cleaned list
for example 
consider this to be your input
names = [" liam ", "KrishU", " vIctOr", " aNu ", "JOHN "]
Then your output should be like
['Liam', 'Krishu', 'Victor', 'Anu', 'John']

Source code:
def clean_names(n):
    refined_names=[]
    for i in n:
        refined_names.append((i.strip()).capitalize())
    return refined_names
names = [" liam ", "KrishU", " vIctOr", " aNu ", "JOHN "]
print(clean_names(names))

Explaination:
1.First we are creating a empty list for storing our changes.
2.then we are looping the elements in the list.
3.now we are modifying each element.
    a.strip()-->used to remove the whitespaces from both sides.
    b.capitalize()-->it changes the format of a string to a general format like starting with a capital  letter and other remaining characters in lowercase until white space.
    c.then we are appending elements in the list.
4.then finally  append each element.
